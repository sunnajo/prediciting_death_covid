## Clean Code & Good Documentation

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job. Another clean and solid project

## Proper Data Science:

- Good job working through all the XGBoost(considering ways to input missing values)
- Attempt ensembling-your recall score is already very good. The ensembling method is often used in Kaggle competitions to increase scores by a small margin. 
  If you revisit the project, maybe something to try. 
- Great visualizations, beautiful streamlit app. 

## Comments:

- Great job on project 3 :)
- Not much to comment on your project. Production ready, clear and concise, top notch project!!
